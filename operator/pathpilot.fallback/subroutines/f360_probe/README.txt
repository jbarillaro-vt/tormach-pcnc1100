XoomSpeed’s integrated probing routines for Fusion 360 and PathPilot developed
by David Loomes.

David hopes that you will realise that there’s a non-trivial amount of effort
involved in creating something like this, so if you would like to make a
donation to support the ongoing support and development, then by all means
send such donations via PayPal to david.loomes@ntlworld.com. There's no
suggested minimum – or maximum – amount, rather it's up to you to decide what
it’s worth to you.

See FusionPathPilotProbing.pdf for details on how to use this with Fusion 360
and PathPilot.

NOTE: Do not copy the Subroutines/*.ngc files to the PathPilot 'subroutines'
folder as FusionPathPilotProbing.pdf instructs you to do. All the subroutines
are already installed in PathPilot and may get updated with PathPilot
releases.
